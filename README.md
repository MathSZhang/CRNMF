# CRNMF: Dropout imputation and dimension reduction for scRNA-seq data using Constrained Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
# Introduction
## This algorithm performs dropout imputation and dimension reduction simultaneously. It is developed under nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) framework, and takes into account the dependency of dropout rate on the sequencing depth in each cell.
## The codes are written in MATLAB. Readers can check demo_deng.m in  demo-CRNMF to see how to use the algorithm.
